**Forecasting and Evaluating Workforce Needs**
- One of the most important skills for a HR professional. How do we identify that need?
	- ==Unit demand== is to understand the volume of business activity as well as how many people are needed to carry out that activity. 
	- ==Trend projections== is to predict future needs based on expectations of how particular employment-related factors may change over time.
	- ==Probabilistic models== are models that predict future conditions using super computers
	- ==Workload analysis== determines the output or productivity the organisation expects to achieve in the immediate future. Then, employment needs are calculated in reverse.
		- Done in three steps. Analyse the type of work, translate that into hours and then into employment needs.
	- ==Ratio analysis== examines historical information about the workforce pertaining to a particular facet of the organisation. 
	- ==Delphi technique== forecasts future job needs by combining the input and expertise of many professional who never meet, but who come to a consensus over time. 
		- %%Må utdype denne%%
	- ==Nominal Group Technique== uses a panel of experts in a structured meeting to find a solution to a problem. 
	- **Forecasting Tools:**
		- ==Job bidding== is expressing interest in a position in an organisation before that position is actually available to be filled. Good for hiring internally and being able to train someone for a position before it actually opens. 
		- ==Succession planning== is identifying promising employees who have the potential to occupy managerial or executive roles in an organisation and then giving them the training they need before the position opens. Usually considered 1-5 years.
		- ==Career pathing== is helping employees map out their long-term professional lives by identifying the career steps they need to take to achieve their career goals. 
		- ==Dual career ladders== is identifying a career path that is rich in expertise and cross-training. Employees master two traditionally disparate roles, and then move on to the next phase. Useful for promising employees that have no interest in managerial positions, and especially relevant to technical fields. 
		- ==Replacement charting== is charting employees as either, ready for promotion, to be developed for future promotion or satisfactory in the current position or to be replaced. 
		- ==Turnover forecasting== is forecasting how many will leave the organisation and need to be replaced. Information can be gathered through exit interviews, post-exit surveys, focus groups and predictive surveys. 
	- **Outsourcing and offshoring:**
		- ==Outsourcing== is a common practice that relies on paying a third-party business to perform a specific function that does not align with the main company's ideals. Often applied to labor-intensive work such as customer service, technical support and computer programming.
		- ==Offshoring== is where a company establishes a foreign subsidiary and transitions from higher-paid American employees to lower-paid foreign employees. Hotly debated practice.
	- ==Independent contractors== are individuals who contract to do specific work for other people or organisations and are not considered employees. Important to know the different rules regarding compensation.
		- The U.S. has the 20 Factor IRS Test and DOL 7 Factors to identify independent contractors. Understanding the difference and similarities between these two tests is important. 
	- ==Gig work== is temporary and flexible, such as Uber and Foodora. The difference between independent contractors and gig workers are still being established, but is related to the level of employer's control, worker's investment, whether it's a temporary or a permanent relationship and the integration of employee's services into the employer's business. 
	- ==Temporary workers== are short-term employees typically hired from a staffing agency. Can be beneficial to avoid a long hiring process, provide flexible options for the employee, to test out possible permanent hires.
		- ![[Pasted image 20240504132256.png|500]]
		- In the U.S., the contract must include job start date, job classification rate of pay and number of employees needed. It's important to use good temporary hiring agencies, as these provide for most of training, pay, et cetera. Compensation take form in one out of three ways:
			1. If working for a temporary agency, the agency is solely responsible for paying the employee.
			2. Temporary workers and independent contractors not employed by agencies are considered self-employed, and receive 1099 tax forms. Organisation not responsible of withholding taxes.
			3. A short-term employee can also be paid through the organisation's payroll system and use W-2. 
	- ==Nonexempt employees== must be paid the federal minimum wage and overtime pay when applicable. Often related to workers paid by the hour. 
	- ==Exempt employees== are exempt from certain provisions of the FLSA, including minimum wage and overtime provisions. 
		- Exemption factors include a salary higher than $684 per week, be salaried and not paid on an hourly basis and perform certain exempt duties as part of his or her job, the most common of these being ==white-collar exemptions==, which are employees whose duties are considered administrative, executive or professional, where the last include doctors, teachers, lawyers and so on. 
	- ==Flexible work arrangements== is work arrangements such as ==remote work==, where the employee is not expected to come into the office. 
		- Advantages of remote work are less commute time, environmental benefits, increased talent pool, increased productivity, health benefits through predictable diet and exercise, higher employee retention and other kinds of cost cutting.
		- Disadvantages include limited interaction, distractions, concerns regarding professional advancement due to not being on site.
		- ==Telecommuting== is working from home through the use of internet, email and phone calls.
		- ==Flex time== is giving the employee more control over what time they work. 
		- ==Compressed work== is allowing an employee for example to work more hours during a specific period of time to get time off later, such as working nine hour days and getting every other Friday off. 
		- ==Job sharing== is splitting a full time job between two or more people. 
		- ==Phased retirement== is to slowly reduce working hours for someone nearing retirement. 

**Job Design and Legislation**
- ==Job design== and job redesign is about identifying the duties, tasks and responsibilities of a job that is needed to increase productivity. Job redesigning is reassessing a job that has already undergone job design and that needs adjustment to make sure morale and motivation remain high. 
- **Tools:**
	- ==Job simplification== takes away a duty from one position and gives it to another. Also known as job specialisation.,
	- ==Job enlargement== increases the variety of a job to make it more meaningful.
	- ==Job enrichment== aims to add more rewarding and stimulating work into a particular job. 
		- ==Horizontal loading== applies to the final two, and is an expansion of the number of tasks someone is responsible of completing. 
		- ==Vertical loading== are when jobs are changed to give workers more authority and responsibility. Often about shifting responsibilities from managers to workers. 
			- Try to load positions based on human needs and motivation of a specific employee rather than organisational goals. Known as the ==human method==. 
		- ==Five dimensions of worker motivation==
			- Skill variety 
				- Describes whether the skills are routine or ever changing
			- Task identity 
				- Related to worker involvement. Is it from start to finish or just a certain part?
			- Task significance
				- Importance of the duty to organisational success or societal success.
			- Autonomy
				- Related to the employee's freedom to vary output.
			- Feedback
				- Opinions on how the employee is doing from managers or supervisors.
		- ==Job redesign best practices==
			- Reconcile differences between the job description and the actual work being done. 
			- Reassign duties to workers with more abilities or motivation. 
			- Offer training for the newly assigned responsibilities.
			- Revise job description and revisit regularly. 
- **Approaches to Job Design**
	- ==Mechanistic approach== is based on classic industrial engineering concepts and shares some common themes with operations research. The focus remains on evaluating a specific job’s simple, repetitive tasks and is most applicable to jobs involving assembly.
	- ==Motivational approach== emphasizes that workers are more satisfied with their jobs if they feel a sense of control, can use their skills, and understand the results of their work. If used correctly, this approach will increase worker satisfaction.
	- ==Biological approach ==is rooted in ergonomics, the study of how workers use machines and equipment for maximum performance. This approach works best for physically demanding jobs.
	- ==Perceptual-motor approach== emphasizes the mental demands of a particular job and identifies the attention span and memory required to perform the job successfully
	- ==Relational approach== evaluates a specific job stage or site. It focuses on the position of  job tasks, within a process, and the relationships of workers to each other and the end-user.
- **Legal Issues in Job Design**
	- Usually in regard to equal employment opportunity, which is aimed to protect employees and potential employees against discriminatory behavior.
		- Title VII of the Civil Rights Act is discrimination in general
		- Age Discrimination in Employment Act
		- Americans with Disabilities Act
		- Pregnancy Discrimination Act
	- Federal laws:
		- ==Fair Labor Standards Act ==says that you must inform whether a job will involve overtime or not and if the job will pay the minimum legal wage. 
		- ==Equal Pay Act ==
	- Benefits:
		- ==Social Security and and the Medicare Act== says that all employers must report and match payments for social security and medicare. 
		- ==Employee Retirement Income and Security Act== details rules regarding retirement. 
		- ==Family and Medical Leave Act== specifies 12 weeks of leave for family and medical reasons. 
	- Health Insurance:
		- Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act allows terminated employees to maintain coverage while searching for a new job. 
		- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act says that you must be able to transfer your health care from an old company to a new. 
	- Safety:
		- Occupational Health and Safety Act outlines workplace safety and health rules and regulations.
		- Fair Claims Act if a work environment is legally unsafe, whistleblower protection may be given. 
		- National Labor Relations Board.
